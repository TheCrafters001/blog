Im honestly thinking gamejolt is becoming exactly like discord

you have communities a literal discord server clone kind of.
you got reactions now which literally look like discord reactions (look at images).
you have the chatting system and group system.

now about the reaction things im expecting "um but actually facebook did reactions first" doesnt matter if facebook did em first since THEY DONT LOOK LIKE DISCORD REACTIONS in fact they look completely different!
REACTIONS in gamejolt look the exact same as discords.
i will not be surprised if gamejolt adds something like nitro in the next few months and end up putting firesides on there nitro clone as an exclusive.

now im going to quote 2001 gamejolt's page

"Our goal at GameJolt.com is to become your #1 reliable source for gaming news, information, reviews, previews, game patches, and demos." 
its clear that this is no longer the case. as these new updates have been more focused on social media then games, i haven't seen the game page updated in forever.

thanks for reading.
