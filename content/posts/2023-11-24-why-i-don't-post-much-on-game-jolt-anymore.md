So. You may be wondering why I don't post on Game Jolt anymore. <!--more--> Well, I honestly just lost interest in the site due to all the changes the website has been making. The website, in my opinion, has been more geared to Creators, which, while I am not opposed to having some way of making money, I dislike the way how hard Creators are pushed on the website.

### The Good

This site is honestly unique in my opinion, the idea of communities is great. It is like a mini forum, but you use social media posts. It is a cool concept. It is unlike any other website I have seen. I also like the idea of having backgrounds on your posts.

I do also like that if I have something on a game I want to announce, I can announce it across my whole profile.


### The Bad

#### Moderation
I am going to be brutally honest, the moderation of this site absolutely SUCKS. I have seen quite a bit on this site that really should NOT be on it. I am not going to say what I have seen, but seriously, something has to change. On top of that, I have seen innocent people get sniped by the mod team because they get mass reported. I once spoke to a GJ mod, and they said to me, directly, "mass reporting isn't a problem."

#### Creators
The push for everyone to be a Creator is kinda annoying. I get that they have to make money and all, but the site runs ads. Plus, if I remember correctly, they take a percentage of game sales.

#### Verification
They just removed the verification program. Unless you are apart of Game Jolt staff, represent a company or development team, or are a Indie dev that hit it off big, you are not getting verified. This is a problem for people, such as myself, who don't want to give Game Jolt my private information to get creator. Plus is a person I know that lost their verification for no apparent reason other than they were taking a break for the month.

Granted, there is a way for you to get your *community* verified, but they ultimately removed the ability for us to get verified on an account level. Plus I already have a [verified community](https://gamejolt.com/c/TF2) that I run, and I honestly am afraid of being impersonated. I spoke about that to a GJ Staff member, and they had told me that impersonation isn't a problem, which has been proven to be false in the past.

### Conclusion
I still log into Game Jolt to maintain my community, but I honestly feel like the bad FAR outweigh the good. I do not plan on going anywhere when it comes to moderating my TF2 community as I have worked hard to build and maintain it. However I do not really want to post or interact with this website anymore. I will try to answer any questions anyone has if you comment them, but other than that, I don't want to post here anymore. If you want to find me, you can just go to my [social page](https://thecrafters001.github.io/social/) on my website.

Oh, and a note to the Game Jolt staff: I know you have had a tendency to delete and eject these kinds of posts. So, I am [keeping this post up on my website](https://thecrafters001.github.io/blog/posts/2023-11-24-why-i-dont-post-much-on-game-jolt-anymore/).
