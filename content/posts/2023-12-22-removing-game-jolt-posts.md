Hi, I am removing a good chunk of my posts from Game Jolt, as I no-longer like the state the site is in. This post is only posted on my website.

I do not wish to associate much with that site anymore, due to all the problems I think it has.

Please, if you need to contact me, find me on a [different social site](/social/) other than Game Jolt. I will not respond to any comments on my posts there.
