Hi everyone! I wanted to let you know that I am taking a long, much needed break from making my fan game. I am just burnt out from making it. I have been working on it since 2017, and I really want to focus on other projects.

I will slowly but surely work on it from time to time, but I will not be updating it any time soon. Sorry.

One last note: I have delisted the game from [Game Jolt](https://gamejolt.com/) and have moved it over to [Itch](https://itch.io/), so please have a look at it over there.
